        <h2 id="list-item-1" class="cat">About Washington Dulles International Airport:</h2>


        <p>Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD) is located in Chantilly, Virginia, on 12,000 acres of land in the suburbs of downtown Washington, DC. The Main Terminal opened in 1962 and was designed by architect Eero Saarinen. Dulles is a
          major hub for domestic and international air travel with a mixture of legacy and low fare carriers that provide air service throughout the world. Flights operate from midfield concourses A, B, C and D and from Z-gates connected to the Main
          Terminal. The Airport has invested in its infrastructure through a major capital program, which included two parking garages, a new airport traffic control tower, expanded B-gates, a new fourth runway, an AeroTrain people mover system and
          an expanded International Arrivals Building. The airport is connected to the region’s highway system via an Authority-operated, 16-mile Airport Access Highway dedicated to airport users. A 23-mile expansion of the region's Metrorail system
          that includes a station at Dulles is under construction.

          Dulles has significant capacity for future growth. With minor expansion, the current facilities could accommodate 45 million annual passengers (22.5 million enplanements). With all future facilities in the master plan constructed, the
          airport could accommodate 70 million annual passengers (35 million enplanements) operating out of 250 airline gates. The current four-runway configuration has a capacity of up to 600,000 aircraft operations per year. With a future fifth
          runway constructed, the airfield capacity could increase to 1 million aircraft operations per year.</p>
        <hr class="rounded">

        <h2 id="list-item-2" class="cat">A Window on the Past…The Gateway to the Future…</h2>
        <p>Although Washington National Airport (now Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport) had been open only since 1941, the need for a second airport to serve the National Capital Area became apparent shortly after the end of World War II. To
          meet the growing demand for airport capacity, Congress passed the Washington Airport Act of 1950 (and amended it further in 1958) to provide for ". . . the construction, protection, operation, and maintenance of a public airport in or in
          the vicinity of the District of Columbia."

          After a thorough study of many possible locations around the region, a 10,000 acre site, 26 miles west of Washington, D.C., was selected by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1958. The site, located in Fairfax and Loudoun Counties in Virginia,
          was surrounded by open farmland and was far enough from other airports to provide adequate airspace for arriving and departing flights.

          The immense size of the new site allowed for an airport, the first in the country designed for commercial jets, to be buffered from its neighbors. Only 3,000 acres of the 10,000 acres were graded for the new airport and boundaries were
          established at least 8,000 feet from the end of all runways. This planning, in conjunction with the actions of local governments to properly zone the land around the site, helped the new airport to be a good neighbor in the Virginia
          countryside.</p>

        <h4>The Terminal Building</h4>
        <p>In May 1958, the engineering firm of Ammann and Whitney of New York was selected by the Civil Aeronautics Administration (forerunner of today's Federal Aviation Administration) as the prime contractor for the airport planning, design, and
          construction supervision. Other professional firms associated with Ammann and Whitney included: Eero Saarinen and Associates of Hamden, Connecticut, architect for the design of the Terminal Building, control tower, and service buildings;
          Burns and McDonnell of Kansas City, for the design of the mechanical, electrical, and utility installations; and Ellery Husted of Washington, D.C., as the master planning consultant.

          Architect Eero Saarinen, wanted to create something more than just another airport -- he wanted to find "the soul of the airport." He designed the Terminal Building and the control tower in that spirit and called it "the best thing I have
          ever done." The Terminal Building was selected for a First Honor Award by the American Institute of Architects in 1966.

          The building of the airport started on September 2, 1958, seven and a half months after the site selection. When it opened four years later, in 1962, Dulles International Airport had a strikingly beautiful Terminal Building which would
          become a landmark to travelers worldwide. The terminal was a compact, two-level structure; 600 feet long and 200 feet wide. While it was built without extensions onto the airfield for aircraft loading, it was designed to be expanded up to
          320 feet at either end (this expansion was actually completed 34 years later in 1996). The Terminal was "topped off" with a distinctive 193-foot high, glass-enclosed, control tower cab which provided the air traffic controllers with an
          unobstructed view for many miles in all directions. </p>
        <h4>Runways</h4>
        <p>When the airport was completed (and after 11.5 million cubic yards of earth excavated), Dulles had two north-south parallel runways, each 11,500 feet long, 150 feet wide, and separated by 6,700 feet and a third northwest-southeast runway,
          10,000 feet long and 150 feet wide. All runways had standard instrument landing systems (ILS) for landings, high-speed turnoffs to increase runway availability, and the most modern lighting systems. In addition, all runways had paved
          shoulders, 25 feet wide, ensuring clean surfaces designed to prevent jet engines from ingesting dirt and debris. </p>
        <h4>The Mobile Lounges</h4>
        <p>In 1962, the feature that made the new airport unique from the public's viewpont were the specially-designed Mobile Lounges, used to transport passengers between the Terminal Building and their aircraft, parked on a jet ramp a half mile
          away from the Terminal. The Mobile Lounge was designed by the Chrysler Corporation in association with the Budd Company.
          The Mobile Lounge was constructed as a 54-foot long, 16-foot wide, 17 1/2-foot high vehicle, capable of carrying 102 passengers, 71 of them seated, directly from the Terminal to the aircraft. The Lounges protected the passengers from
          weather, jet noise and blast, and eliminated long walking distances. Because of the Mobile Lounges, after first entering the Terminal, passengers had only a minor distance to walk before they were seated on the Lounge for the short trip
          directly to the aircraft.</p>
        <h4>Access Roads</h4>
        <p>As Dulles was being designed, a complete study was made of the possibility of adjusting plans for future state and federal highways so that the airport would have access to adequate transportation arteries. This did not prove feasible, and
          the decision was made to construct an access highway as part of the airport development project. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), in cooperation with local communities, selected four possible routes, which were the subject of
          several public hearings. The final selection was a 16-mile route from the airport to a point near Falls Church, Virginia, where it would be connected at a later date to the then proposed Interstate Route 66 and the Capital Beltway. The
          first 13.5 miles of the highway were built at the time of the original airport construction work, connecting the airport to Routes 495 (the Capital Beltway) and 123 near McLean, Virginia. Upon completion of I-66 through Arlington, Virginia,
          in early 1983, Dulles Airport Access Highway was extended the last 2.5 miles to connect directly with I-66.</p>
        <h4>Grand Opening</h4>
        <p>Dulles International Airport was named for the late Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and was formally dedicated by President John F. Kennedy on November 17, 1962 (the airport was renamed Washington Dulles International Airport in
          1984). The ceremony was attended by former President Dwight D. Eisenhower, members of the Dulles family, many dignitaries and thousands of spectators. The new airport was a symbol of America's stature and progress into the jet age, and was
          an impressive gateway to the nation's capital. An Eastern Airlines Super Electra, on a flight from Newark, New Jersey, was the first commercial aircraft to land at the new airport.

          The soaring beauty of the new Terminal Building and the airport's unique Mobile Lounges impressed the many sightseers, travelers, foreign visitors, and diplomats who came to the airport. Dulles was also one of the first airports in the
          country to adopt the Accelerated Inspection System where representatives of the U.S. Customs Service, U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, and U.S. Department of Agriculture work together to process arriving international
          passengers.

          From the grand opening through the end of 1962, Dulles served 52,846 passengers. Annual passenger traffic reached one million in 1966. </p>
        <h4>Through the Years</h4>
        <p>Built in 1962 to accommodate up to six million passengers a year, Washington Dulles International Airport was one of the most modern airports in the world. As the number of passengers increased, the airport had to grow as well. The first
          expansion was completed in November 1977 with the widening of the jet parking ramp. In 1982, new passenger waiting areas were added to the upper level and a new baggage make-up area was added below to handle increased airport activity.
          Midfield Concourses C and D, five cargo buildings, a hotel located on airport property, and economy parking lots were also added through the 1980's. The Terminal was expanded in accordance with the original Saarinen design in 1996. In 1998,
          the first permanent concourse was completed and a concourse for regional aircraft opened in 1999.</p>
        <h4>The Growing Years</h4>
        <p>Dulles Airport consistently served between two and three million passengers annually from 1969 through 1983. Then the true vision of Dulles began to emerge.

          Dulles served 2.5 million passengers in 1975, compared with 11.7 million at the more established National Airport. With more than five million passengers in 1985 and ten million in 1987, Dulles was taking its place among the major airports
          on the East Coast. A decade of steady, continuous growth paved the way for surging numbers in the last years of the 20th Century. From 1996 to 1999, Dulles passenger totals increased 65%. In 1999, Dulles served 19.8 million passengers, a
          26% increase over 1998. The airport saw nearly 470,000 aircraft operations, a 23% increase compared to just a year earlier. Dulles went from serving 1.4 million international passengers in 1990 to more than 3.5 million in 1999.

          During this time, the airport undertook a major Capital Development Program to accommodate the growth. TheTerminal was expanded in 1996 to meet the original vision of Eero Saarinen. The expanded Terminal contains 1.1 million square feet of
          floor space, measures 1,240 feet in length and replicates the curved roofline and glass curtainwall of the original design. Passengers now benefit from the expanded baggage and ticketing areas and wider arrival and departure roadways. The
          construction also added a new International Arrivals Building in 1991, improved flight and baggage information display systems, new roadways and overpasses, new aircraft gates and aprons for additional aircraft parking, taxiway and runway
          improvements.

          In 1998, completion of the first permanent concourse (Concourse B) was completed with 442,000 square feet to serve 20 aircraft positions. One year later, a regional jet concourse (Concourse A, Gates 1-6) was opened to serve 36 regional
          aircraft. A sky bridge, offering an unbeatable view of Dulles' airfield, connects Concourse A's regional gates to the International A Gates. Concourse B expanded in 2003 and again in 2008, increasing the length of the Concourse A-B building
          to 2,810 feet.

          Several new cargo buildings were added throughout the mid 1990's to meet the double-digit growth in cargo flying through the airport. Additionally, Dulles increased its parking capacity by 111% in just two years and now has more than 23,000
          parking spaces.

          As the 21st Century began, Dulles emerged as one of the fastest growing airports in the world and a major East Coast gateway for domestic and international travelers, as well as cargo activities. The airport is achieving the potential its
          planners had envisioned, and beyond. Dulles Airport has been an economic engine for the surrounding communities, providing over 15,000 direct jobs and billions of dollars in business revenue. The "Dulles Corridor" is now synonymous with
          growth and future potential for the region. </p>

        <h4>The Future Arrives</h4>
        <p>Just as it was the vision of Eero Saarinen that the Terminal of Washington Dulles International Airport could be expanded to meet future growth, so is it the mission of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority to ensure that the
          entire airport continues to meet the growing aviation needs of the region.

          In the summer of 2000, the Airports Authority launched the Dulles Development Program (D2) taking Dulles closer to its full potential. The Program included building two new parking garages, a fourth runway, a new concourse, a new Air
          Traffic Control Tower, pedestrian walkways, the AeroTrain System and an expansion of the International Arrivals Building.

          This program will continue to develop Dulles as was envisioned in the Master Plan. At full build-out, Dulles will handle 55 million passengers a year (150,000 a day) and become one of the world's major airports. The story of Dulles
          continues to unfold as it meets the passenger and cargo needs of the 21st century.</p>
